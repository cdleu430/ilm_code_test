# ILM Code Test for Chris Leu

_Description:_ A simple priority queue implemented in python.

## Usage

You may run tests or write your python script to utilize the
heap_priority_queue module. The client.py file includes an example
of using the queue, while tests/test_ilm_prio_queue.py represents a set of
unit tests. This was not developed to actually be deployed anywhere, so you
will likely need to modify the sys.path.append commands at the top of each
file to use it.
